# Mobile-analysis

# Project Explanation

I obtained a comprehensive mobile phone dataset stored in a MySQL database. This dataset contains crucial information about various mobile phones, including brand, model, features, and prices. To extract meaningful insights from this data, I employed SQL queries to retrieve specific information.

Once the data was structured, I visualized it using Power BI. This visualization tool allowed me to create an interactive dashboard, presenting key metrics and trends related to the mobile phone market. The dashboard provides users with an intuitive platform to explore and gain valuable insights into mobile phone pricing, features, and trends.
